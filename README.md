## Bio

📜 Initially trained in applied mathematics (numerical analysis, modeling, simulation), I have started working with data and the pydata stack in 2013, when I was an energy efficiency researcher (successfully evading the Matlab ecosystem!).
I then switched to my current role as a Head of Analytics & Data Science for Franprix, a french proximity retailer. My team and I handle the whole analytics process, advising data producers, building data pipelines, implementing ML algorithms, serving reports and dashboards.

🙏 As a team we rely a lot on open source libraries and try to give back as much as we can!
